# Harp151_Final_Project

Here is our final project

We were able to call an API and gather real time information relating to 
stocks.
Using this information we developed an HTML to show this data.
To get an output from the code the user enters their desired stock
symbol in all caps in order to recieve certain information regarding
that company.
